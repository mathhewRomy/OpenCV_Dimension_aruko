# OpenCV_Dimension_aruko
The code in this repository tries to accurately predict the dimensions of an object using OpenCV. To obtain the pixel to real size ratio a 5X5 aruko marker is used for reference.

I have used my smartphone camera as the input using IP camera.

Finally I referred Mr.Sergio's videos from the Pysource Youtube channel.
